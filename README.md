OpenXR SDK for Unity

/Docs/images/oxr_for_unity.png

The goal for this repo is to wrap KHR OpenXR loader in a Unity plugin to make XR Apps work on Pico, Quest and other OpenXR compliant devices.
I'll wrap features like Pass through, Hand Tracking, Perf level, etc to Unity plugin.

If you're not interested in Vendor specific features, or device specific features, you could choose this plugin, so your Apps will be able to support XR features across various XR Hardwares.
